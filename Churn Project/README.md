# Customer Churn Prediction App

## Project Description
This is a data science project that aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The project involves a complete end-to-end workflow, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning model training to the deployment of an interactive web application using Streamlit.

The application allows users to input customer data and receive a real-time prediction on whether the customer is likely to churn.

## Problem Statement
Customer churn, or the loss of customers, is a significant problem for many businesses. By accurately predicting which customers are at risk of churning, a company can proactively intervene with targeted strategies to improve retention. This project uses historical customer data to build a predictive model to identify these at-risk customers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, etc.)
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework for deployment
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Data visualization
