End-to-End Customer Churn Prediction Project
1. Executive Summary
This project demonstrates a full data science lifecycle, from initial data understanding to the deployment of a predictive model. The primary objective was to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The final output is an interactive web application that allows users to input customer data and receive an instant churn prediction, providing a valuable tool for business decision-making.

2. Problem Statement & Business Context
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, as acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones. By identifying customers who are likely to churn, the business can implement proactive strategies, such as personalized offers or support, to improve customer retention. This model serves as a key tool for such interventions.

3. Data Source and Description
The dataset used for this project is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, available on Kaggle. It contains customer account information, demographic data, and service usage details.

Source: Kaggle

Key Features:

gender, SeniorCitizen, Partner, Dependents: Demographic information.

tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges: Account-related information.

PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService: Service subscription details.

Contract, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod: Billing and contract details.

Target Variable:

Churn: A categorical variable indicating whether a customer left the company in the last month (Yes or No).

4. Methodology and Workflow
4.1. Data Analysis and Cleaning
Initial Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions, identify missing values, and analyze feature correlations.

Missing Values: Handled missing values in the TotalCharges column by replacing them with the median value, as the number of missing entries was small.

Outliers: Checked for and handled outliers in numerical features like MonthlyCharges to ensure model stability.

Categorical Encoding: Converted all categorical features (including the target variable Churn) into numerical representations using a simple label encoding strategy.

4.2. Feature Engineering & Visualization
Data Visualization: Created a series of plots to visualize key relationships in the data, including:

A pie chart showing the distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers.

Bar charts comparing MonthlyCharges and tenure by contract type.

Heatmaps to visualize the correlation between all numerical variables.

4.3. Model Building & Evaluation
Model Selection: Trained and evaluated several supervised machine learning models to find the best performer. The following models were considered:

Logistic Regression

K-Neighbors Classifier

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluation Metrics: Model performance was evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. This provided a comprehensive view of how well each model performed beyond simple accuracy.

Final Model: The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was selected as the final model due to its superior performance on the evaluation metrics. The trained model was then saved as a .pkl file for later use in the web application.

5. Deployment with Streamlit
The final part of the project involved deploying the trained model in a user-friendly application.

Platform: Streamlit was used to build a simple and interactive web application.

Functionality: The application allows users to input various customer details via a form. This input is then processed, passed to the saved model, and a prediction (Churn or No Churn) is displayed on the screen.

6. Project Files and Repository Structure
The project repository is structured for clarity and ease of use, following industry best practices.

app.py: The main Streamlit application script.

model.pkl: The serialized, pre-trained machine learning model.

notebooks/eda_and_modeling.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis and model training process.

requirements.txt: A list of all required Python libraries to run the project.

.gitignore: A configuration file to exclude temporary files and folders from version control.

README.md: High-level overview of the project and instructions for setup.

data/raw/telco_data.csv: The raw dataset used for the project.
