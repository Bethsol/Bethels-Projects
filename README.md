2. ðŸ“º Shark Tank US - Power BI 
This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Shark Tank US dataset, created using Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of deal performance, investor contributions, and key trends across multiple seasons.

Project Goal: The primary goal of this project was to transform raw data into actionable insights. By creating an interactive dashboard, I aimed to uncover patterns in investment trends, analyze the performance of individual "sharks," and identify the key factors that lead to a successful deal on the show.

Key Skills: Data Transformation, Data Modeling, Dashboard Design, Business Intelligence.

Technologies: Power BI Desktop, Power Query, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
