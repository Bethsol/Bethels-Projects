Analytics & Data Science  Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my data science and analytics projects, demonstrating my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence. Each project folder contains a dedicated README.md with a detailed overview, methodology, and instructions for reproducibility.

Projects
1. Customer Churn Prediction
An end-to-end data science project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecom company. This project demonstrates a complete workflow from data analysis and model training to web application deployment.

Project Goal: To build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning, enabling proactive business interventions.

Key Skills: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Visualization, Feature Engineering, Supervised Machine Learning (SVC, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees), Model Evaluation.

Technologies: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Streamlit.

2. Shark Tank US - Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is an exploratory data analysis of the Shark Tank US dataset, created using Power BI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of deal performance, investor contributions, and key trends across multiple seasons.

Project Goal: The primary goal of this project was to transform raw data into actionable insights. By creating an interactive dashboard, I aimed to uncover patterns in investment trends, analyze the performance of individual "sharks," and identify the key factors that lead to a successful deal on the show.

Key Skills: Data Transformation, Data Modeling, Dashboard Design, Business Intelligence.

Technologies: Power BI Desktop, Power Query, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).

3. SQL Data Analysis
This project is a data analysis using SQL. It focuses on writing efficient and complex queries to extract, transform, and analyze data directly from a relational database. This showcases my ability to manipulate and derive insights from structured data without relying on external libraries.

Project Goal: To showcase advanced SQL skills by performing complex data analysis tasks, such as creating aggregated reports, analyzing user behavior, and joining data from multiple tables.

Key Skills: SQL Queries (Window Functions, CTEs, Joins), Data Aggregation, Database Management.

Technologies: SQL, [Database Platform e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL].

Technical Skills
Programming: Python, SQL
Databases & Tools: Git, GitHub
